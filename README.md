# Malaria Detection with CNN Models

This repository contains code for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for malaria detection using three different approaches: Sequential model, Functional API, and Subclassing. Each approach is implemented in a separate Python file.

## Models

1. **Sequential Model**: The Sequential approach is implemented in `malaria_classifiaction.ipynb`. This file contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the Sequential CNN model for malaria detection.

2. **Functional API Model**: The Functional API approach is implemented in `functional_api_malaria.ipynb`. This file contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the Functional API CNN model for malaria detection.

3. **Subclassing Model**: The Subclassing approach is implemented in `subclassing_model.ipynb`. This file contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the Subclassing CNN model for malaria detection.

## Visualization and Evaluation Metrics

Each model includes visualization techniques and calculates the following evaluation metrics:

- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall
- Accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- AUC ROC Plot
